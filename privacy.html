      <h1 class="mt-5", style="font-family:verdana;">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Effective Date: November 28, 2023</p>
      <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Notacia is committed to protecting the privacy of your data. This Privacy Policy explains what information Notacia Corporation and its Group Companies collect, use, and disclose about you when you access or use our websites and applications, which we refer to collectively as the Notacia Service, contact our customer service team, engage with us on social media, or otherwise interact with us.<br>

         Please note, if you are an Individual Account user, you are both the Account Holder and End User of a Notacia Service account. If you use Notacia Business, the Account Holder is the Customer who has contracted with Notacia as defined in our Notacia Business Agreement and the End Users are the individuals whose user accounts are linked to that Notacia Business account. You can find these and other defined terms used in this policy in our Glossary.<br>
      
         If you are an End User of an Notacia Business account, please note that the Account Holder of your Notacia Business account (such as your employer or organization) may have established its own rules regarding End Users’ access, use, disclosure, or retention of data stored in that account. Also note that while an Administrator of an Notacia Business account has access to the End User accounts linked to that Notacia Business account, an Administrator cannot access any other accounts that are not linked to the Notacia Business account. You can find more information on how your individual Notacia Service account works with your Notacia Business account by visiting website.<br>
      
         Although significant changes are rare, this policy may be amended as new features, technology, or legal requirements arise, so please check back from time to time. We’ll notify you if we make a significant change and, where required, seek your consent. </p>

      <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">What information does Notacia collect?</h2>
      <p>Notacia allows you to input, upload, or store in the Notacia Service any text, images, and other data that you choose—we refer to that information as “Content”. We also collect and receive the following types of information:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Basic subscriber information:</b> To open your account and process payments, we collect and receive identifiers like your email address and, depending on how you purchase a subscription to a Paid Service, your billing address and other payment information.</li>
            <li><b>Usage data:</b> We collect and log Internet or other electronic network information on how you and others access and use Notacia, for example, the act of creating a note or sharing a note. Usage data may be collected through cookies, and similar technologies. For more information, including how to opt-out, visit our Cookie Information page.</li> 
            <li><b>Location information:</b> We collect the IP address you use to connect to the Notacia Service and — if you choose to share it — your location information from a mobile device.</li> 
            <li><b>Device information:</b> We collect information about the number and type of devices you use to connect to the Notacia Service, as well as information about the operating systems on those devices (e.g., iOS, Android, Windows). For example, when you install, modify, or use an Notacia we may collect personal information in order for our services to function properly, such as your device’s unique hardware identifiers (IMEI, SIM number, or other identifier). When you install, modify, or use an Notacia application, you may see permission requests or alerts regarding the device capabilities the application could potentially use.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">How does Notacia use my information</h2>
      <p>We have specific rules for how and when we use the information we collect and receive. We are committed to protecting the privacy of your information. We use the information we collect and receive to provide, maintain, and improve the Notacia Service; to provide troubleshooting and customer support; to protect the Evernote Service for all our users; to contact you; and to administer Evernote Business accounts. 
        <ul>
            <li><b>Performing our Services:</b> We use a number of technologies to help you get the most out of the Notacia Service. Our systems automatically analyze your data to power Notacia features and to continually improve the Notacia Service for you in a way that does not require anyone to look at your Content. This may include, for example: undefined.</li>
            <li><b>Maintaining our Services:</b> To provide troubleshooting and customer support, our Customer Support team may need to access your information, such as your account email address and information about the Notacia application you are using, subject to the protections described below.</li>
            <li><b>Protecting against security threats, abuse, and illegal activity:</b> As part of our efforts to protect your account and the functionality of the Notacia Service, our systems may analyze the emails you send to and from your Notacia account and the notes you share to detect spam, malware, or other potential security concerns. If we determine that such material constitutes a Terms of Service or User Guidelines violation, we may block delivery of or unshare the problematic material, much like a spam filter works for your email inbox.<br>
        
             Learn more about steps you can take to protect your account, such as using strong passwords, two-step verification, and encryption.</li>
            <li><b> Communicating with you:</b> In accordance with your communication preferences, we’ll occasionally contact you to announce new products and features we build for you, share tips for using Notacia to get more done, make special offers, and provide information about how Notacia works with products and services from our business partners.Learn MoreShow Less</li>
            <li><b>Complying with Law:</b> Notacia also uses information to satisfy applicable laws or regulations, and discloses information in response to legal process or enforceable government requests, including to law enforcement. For more information, please visit the section “How does Notacia respond to legal requests for my information?” of this Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3 style="font-family:verdana;">Would someone at Notacia ever view my Content?</h3>
        
      <p>You have control over who sees your Content. We limit the use of your Content to make sure that no one at Evernote can view it unless you expressly give us permission or it’s necessary to comply with our legal obligations. Specifically:
        <ul>
            <li>To help refine or improve the technology, we may ask you for permission to review portions of your Content. For example, if a new feature suggests related notes that are relevant to your Content, we may give you an opportunity to provide us feedback on how well the feature is performing along with a sample of the Content in question, so we can make sure this feature provides appropriately tailored suggestions. Such access to your Content is done only with your express permission and is subject to strict confidentiality rules and data access controls. Choosing to give us such permission is completely voluntary.</li>
            <li>If you contact our Customer Support team for help with specific pieces of Content in your account (for example, if you can’t find a note you believe should be in your account), we may ask for your temporary permission to look at your Content. This permission terminates when the issue is resolved.<br>Learn MoreShow Less</li>
            <li>If we become aware of a potential violation of our Terms of Service or User Guidelines, we may suspend or close your account until the problematic material is removed. Under such a circumstance, we would only look at the Content in your account if you give us consent or if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, including to protect the safety of you or any other person.</li>
        </ul>    
        To test and improve our product offerings for our users, we use aggregated data that does not contain any personal information, does not identify any person, and cannot be connected to any specific user. This policy is not intended to apply to such anonymized/de-identified data.</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">How does Notacia share or disclose my information?</h2>
      <p>Notacia is not in the business of selling or renting your information. Here are instances when we may disclose your information — and then only the minimum information necessary:
        <ul>
            <li>We share your information with service providers who process data on our behalf, such as credit card processors and customer management systems. For example, these service providers help us:
                undefinedundefinedundefinedundefined </li>
        </ul>
        We require these providers to agree to strict data protection requirements in keeping with our privacy policy standards and our obligations under data protection laws. We do not share your information with any third parties for their own advertising purposes.Learn MoreShow Less<br>

        <ul>
            <li>Your Content is private unless you decide you want to share it. You may choose to share using public links or through any of the Notacia Service’s features that allow you to share or collaborate on Content (“Collaboration Features”). If you choose to share, we may need to take steps to facilitate your collaboration.  Learn MoreShow Less</li>
            <li>In the event of a merger, sale, or reorganization of all or part of our business, information covered by this policy may be transferred in connection with that deal. </li>
            <li>As described on our Cookie Information page, we contract with third-party advertising networks in order to deliver relevant Notacia advertisements to you across the Internet and to manage our communications with you. We do not use your Content for these purposes. In addition, we may share with partners or service providers a hashed identifier to serve you relevant Evernote ads when you visit partners’ and providers’ websites, applications or platforms. We may, for instance, participate in the Google Adwords Remarketing, Twitter Tailored Audience and Facebook Custom Audience services. To learn more about the privacy controls that Google, Twitter and Facebook offer and honor for those respective services, please visit here for Google, here for Twitter, and here for Facebook. You may opt out of certain ad targeting and retargeting services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page, or the Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out page.</li>
            <li>We also may exchange information about you with third parties whenever you consent to or direct such sharing. This includes, for example, if you connect your Notacia account with a third-party app in our App Center.Learn MoreShow Less</li>
